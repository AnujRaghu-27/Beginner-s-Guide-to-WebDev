      <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
      <p>Web development means creating and maintaining websites. It includes designing the layout, writing the structure, and styling the web pages to make them look attractive and work properly. Web development is mainly divided into two parts — Front-End and Back-End.</p>

      <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
      <p>Front-End is the part of a website that users see and interact with. It focuses on how the website looks and feels.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML – used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
        <li>CSS – used to design and style the webpage.</li>
        <li>JavaScript – used to make the webpage interactive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
      <p>Back-End is the behind-the-scenes part of a website. It handles how the website works, connects with databases, and stores information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Languages: Python, Java, PHP</li>
        <li>Databases: MySQL, MongoDB</li>
        <li>Servers: Apache, Node.js</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
      <p>A Full-Stack Developer works on both front-end and back-end. They can design how the website looks and also manage how it works behind the scenes.</p>
