      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create the structure and content of a website. With HTML, we can add text, images, links, and tables to web pages.</p>
      <p>Think of HTML as the skeleton of a web page — it organizes everything you see on the screen.</p>

      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language used to style and design web pages — deciding how everything looks. With CSS, you can set colors, fonts, layouts, backgrounds, and spacing to make a website visually appealing.</p>
      <p>It helps turn a plain page into a beautiful and well-structured design. CSS also allows websites to adjust their layout for different screen sizes, making them responsive and user-friendly on phones, tablets, and computers.</p>

      <h2>What is JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language that makes web pages interactive and dynamic. It allows you to add features like animations, pop-ups, buttons that respond to clicks, and real-time updates — all without reloading the page.</p>
      <p>It’s one of the most important skills for web developers because it helps create engaging and responsive user experiences.</p>
